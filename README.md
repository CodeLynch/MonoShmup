This is a repository for a shmup game project I built in order to learn and practice the Monogame framework. I coded this project along with the very helpful [Batholith Entertainment Monogame Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ6ofHM1rvK8lQSoKX1USZstM-ZXikFHp) on YouTube, but I also added my own twists and quirks based on what I learned.
